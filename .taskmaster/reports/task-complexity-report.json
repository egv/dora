			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Infrastructure with uv",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project infrastructure setup into subtasks for repository structure, Python environment, dependency management, CI pipeline, documentation, and pre-commit hooks.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves multiple distinct steps (structure, environment, dependencies, CI, docs, hooks), each with clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Breaking into subtasks improves clarity and parallelization."

			"taskTitle": "Implement A2A Protocol Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the A2A protocol implementation into subtasks for base agent class, capability discovery, message format, retry logic, authentication, versioning, and logging/tracing.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational, high-complexity task with multiple architectural components and integration points. Each component (agent, discovery, messaging, retry, auth, versioning, logging) is complex and benefits from focused subtasks."
