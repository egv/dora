Example code for opportunity score calculation:
```python
def calculate_opportunity_score(day_data):
    base_score = 50  # Start with neutral score
    
    # Event density factor (0-20 points)
    event_count = len(day_data['events'])
    event_score = min(20, event_count * 2)
    
    # Weather favorability (0-15 points)
    weather = day_data['weather']
    weather_score = 15 if weather['condition'] in ['clear', 'sunny'] else \
                   10 if weather['condition'] in ['partly_cloudy'] else \
                   5 if weather['condition'] in ['cloudy'] else \
                   0
    
    # Holiday/payday proximity (0-25 points)
    holiday_score = 25 if day_data['is_holiday'] else \
                   15 if day_data['days_to_holiday'] <= 3 else \
                   10 if day_data['is_payday'] else \
                   0
    
    # Cultural considerations (0-15 points)
    cultural_score = 15 if day_data['cultural_significance'] == 'high' else \
                    10 if day_data['cultural_significance'] == 'medium' else \
                    0
    
    # Historical engagement (0-25 points)
    historical_score = min(25, day_data['historical_engagement'] * 25)
    
    return base_score + event_score + weather_score + holiday_score + cultural_score + historical_score
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each sub-agent
2. Integration tests for the complete agent
3. Test data collection from multiple sources
4. Verify verification pipeline with known test cases
5. Test calendar construction with mock data
6. Benchmark performance against requirements
7. Test opportunity score calculation with various scenarios
8. Verify A2A capability interfaces
9. Test data persistence and retrieval
10. Validate error handling and recovery

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Base Agent Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational architecture for the agent, including the core decision-making engine, task management, and integration points for sub-agents and tools.
### Details:
Define the agent's core modules, interfaces for sub-agents, and the main workflow for task orchestration. Ensure extensibility for future capabilities such as multi-source collection, verification, and calendar building.

## 2. Develop Multi-Source Collector Module [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a collector capable of aggregating and normalizing data from multiple heterogeneous sources.
### Details:
Implement logic for connecting to various data sources, handling data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), and managing source-specific configurations. Ensure the collector can handle directory structures and mapping for each source as needed.
<info added on 2025-07-08T19:49:56.438Z>
Implementation of multi-source collector with real data sources completed successfully. The following components have been integrated:

- EventCollector: Integrated with EventSearchAgent via A2A protocol with exponential backoff retry logic
- WeatherCollector: Integrated with OpenWeatherMap API 
- HolidayCollector: Comprehensive holiday and cultural event data
- EnhancedMultiSourceCollector: Orchestrates all collectors with concurrent execution

Technical achievements include:
- A2A Integration with fixed endpoint routing, request format, and response parsing
- Containerization using Podman/Docker with multi-stage builds
- PostgreSQL database schema with events, weather_data, and calendar_insights tables
- Health check endpoints added to all agents
- Comprehensive A2A communication tests
- Complete container deployment documentation

The EventCollector now uses proper A2A JSON-RPC format with retry logic and circuit breaker. All mock data fallbacks have been removed for clear production data visibility. The system is containerized and production-ready with PostgreSQL schema including indexes, triggers, and sample data. Redis caching infrastructure has been prepared.

Next steps will focus on connecting agents to PostgreSQL for data persistence, implementing Redis caching layer, and completing the Data Verifier and Calendar Builder sub-agents.
