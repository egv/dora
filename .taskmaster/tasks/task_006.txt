# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Audience Analysis Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Audience Analysis Agent to analyze hyperlocal calendars, determine target audiences, predict behavior patterns, and provide marketing insights.
# Details:
Implement the Audience Analysis Agent with the following components:

1. Create base agent structure using the A2A protocol framework

2. Implement core analysis capabilities:
   - Behavioral prediction models
   - Cultural alignment algorithms
   - Economic timing analysis
   - Seasonal pattern recognition
   - Convergence opportunity identification

3. Develop machine learning models:
   - Attendance prediction model using historical data
   - Demographic interest correlation
   - Weather impact analysis
   - Economic factor influence

4. Implement demographic analysis:
   - Age group segmentation
   - Interest categorization
   - Income level classification
   - Cultural background analysis

5. Create ROI estimation:
   - Marketing cost calculation
   - Engagement prediction
   - Conversion modeling
   - Return calculation

6. Implement recommendation engine:
   - Target group prioritization
   - Channel selection
   - Timing optimization
   - Message type suggestions

7. Expose A2A capabilities:
   - AnalyzeAudience

Example code for audience analysis:
```python
async def analyze_audience(event, location_demographics, historical_data_available=True):
    # Base audience profile
    base_profile = determine_base_profile(event)
    
    # Enhance with location demographics
    enhanced_profile = enhance_with_demographics(base_profile, location_demographics)
    
    # Apply contextual factors
    if historical_data_available:
        historical_patterns = await get_historical_patterns(event.type, event.location)
        enhanced_profile = apply_historical_patterns(enhanced_profile, historical_patterns)
    
    # Weather impact analysis
    weather_forecast = await get_weather_forecast(event.location, event.date)
    weather_adjusted_profile = adjust_for_weather(enhanced_profile, weather_forecast)
    
    # Economic factors
    economic_context = await get_economic_context(event.location, event.date)
    final_profile = adjust_for_economic_factors(weather_adjusted_profile, economic_context)
    
    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_marketing_recommendations(final_profile, event)
    
    return {
        "target_groups": final_profile.target_groups,
        "predicted_attendance": calculate_attendance_prediction(final_profile, event),
        "recommendations": recommendations
    }
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each analysis component
2. Integration tests for the complete agent
3. Test with various event types and locations
4. Verify prediction accuracy with historical data
5. Test demographic analysis with different profiles
6. Benchmark performance against requirements
7. Test recommendation quality with expert evaluation
8. Verify A2A capability interfaces
9. Test with and without historical data
10. Validate error handling and recovery
