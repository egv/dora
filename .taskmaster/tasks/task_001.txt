# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure with uv
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure and setup Python environment using uv as the package manager.
# Details:
Create a new repository with the following structure:
- `/agents/` - Directory for all agent implementations
- `/mcp_tools/` - Directory for MCP tool implementations
- `/models/` - Directory for data models
- `/api/` - Directory for API gateway
- `/tests/` - Directory for tests

Setup Python environment:
1. Install uv: `curl -sSf https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
2. Create pyproject.toml with Python 3.11+ requirement
3. Initialize virtual environment: `uv venv`
4. Add core dependencies:
   - FastAPI 0.100.0+
   - Pydantic 2.0+
   - Redis 4.5.0+
   - psycopg2-binary 2.9.6+
   - httpx 0.24.0+
   - pytest 7.3.1+
   - python-dotenv 1.0.0+
5. Create .env.example file with required environment variables
6. Setup .gitignore for Python projects
7. Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
8. Setup pre-commit hooks for code quality

Implement CI pipeline with GitHub Actions for:
- Linting with flake8/black
- Type checking with mypy
- Running tests with pytest
- Building Docker images

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project structure is correctly set up
2. Ensure uv commands work as expected: `uv sync`, `uv add`, `uv run python`
3. Confirm virtual environment is created and activated
4. Validate CI pipeline runs successfully on push
5. Check that all dependencies can be installed with `uv sync`
