# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Message Generation Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Message Generation Agent with its three sub-agents: Generator, Editor, and Validator.
# Details:
Implement the Message Generation Agent with the following components:

1. Create base agent structure using the A2A protocol framework

2. Implement Generator Sub-Agent:
   - Integrate with OpenAI/Anthropic API for text generation
   - Create prompt templates for different message types
   - Implement language detection and support
   - Add social group targeting parameters
   - Create format-specific generators (push, SMS, email)

3. Implement Editor Sub-Agent:
   - Create message refinement logic
   - Implement length adjustment algorithms
   - Add emotional appeal enhancement
   - Create readability optimization
   - Implement brand voice consistency rules

4. Implement Validator Sub-Agent:
   - Create validation pipeline with multiple criteria
   - Implement language accuracy checking
   - Add cultural sensitivity validation
   - Create character/word limit validation
   - Implement engagement potential scoring
   - Add legal compliance checking

5. Implement iterative process flow:
   - Create generation-validation-editing loop
   - Add maximum iteration control (5 loops)
   - Implement quality threshold checks
   - Create early exit conditions
   - Add timeout handling

6. Expose A2A capabilities:
   - GenerateMessage
   - ChatMode

7. Implement quality metrics:
   - Engagement score prediction
   - Readability scoring
   - Cultural appropriateness evaluation
   - Format compliance checking

Example code for message generation:
```python
async def generate_message(event, target_language, social_group, output_format, context=None, quality_threshold=8.5, max_iterations=5):
    # Initial generation
    prompt = build_prompt(event, target_language, social_group, output_format, context)
    draft = await generate_text(prompt)
    
    # Validation and editing loop
    iterations = 1
    while iterations < max_iterations:
        validation_result = validate_message(draft, target_language, social_group, output_format)
        
        if validation_result.score >= quality_threshold:
            break
            
        edit_instructions = build_edit_instructions(validation_result)
        draft = await edit_message(draft, edit_instructions)
        iterations += 1
    
    return {
        "message": draft,
        "quality_score": validation_result.score,
        "iterations": iterations,
        "validation_details": validation_result.details
    }
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each sub-agent
2. Integration tests for the complete agent
3. Test message generation in multiple languages
4. Verify validation criteria with known test cases
5. Test editing capabilities with various inputs
6. Benchmark performance against requirements
7. Test iteration control and quality thresholds
8. Verify A2A capability interfaces
9. Test with various social groups and formats
10. Validate error handling and recovery

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Base Structure of the Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational architecture for the agent, including core components such as memory, routing, and task management layers.
### Details:
Define the agent's main modules, persistent memory, and routing logic to enable modularity and support sub-agents. Ensure the structure supports integration with tools and external functions.

## 2. Implement Generator Sub-Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the generator sub-agent responsible for creating initial outputs or solutions based on input data and goals.
### Details:
Integrate LLM or other generative models to produce candidate outputs. Ensure compatibility with the agent's memory and routing systems.

## 3. Develop Editor Sub-Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the editor sub-agent to refine, modify, or enhance outputs generated by the generator.
### Details:
Implement logic for iterative editing, leveraging memory and context to improve quality. Ensure the editor can interact with both generator outputs and validation feedback.

## 4. Build Validator Sub-Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Construct the validator sub-agent to assess the quality, correctness, and compliance of generated and edited outputs.
### Details:
Define validation criteria and implement automated checks. Integrate feedback mechanisms to inform the editor and generator of detected issues.

## 5. Establish Iterative Process Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Set up the iterative loop that cycles outputs through generation, editing, and validation until quality thresholds are met.
### Details:
Implement workflow orchestration to manage dependencies, track progress, and handle failures or rework as needed. Ensure the process can adapt to changing requirements or feedback.

## 6. Integrate Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Enable communication and collaboration between multiple agents or sub-agents for distributed or specialized task handling.
### Details:
Develop protocols for message passing, task delegation, and result aggregation among agents. Ensure security and consistency in inter-agent interactions.

## 7. Define and Implement Quality Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish objective metrics and evaluation methods to measure the performance and output quality of the agent and its sub-agents.
### Details:
Select relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, completeness, efficiency), implement automated measurement tools, and integrate reporting into the workflow for continuous improvement.
