# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement A2A Protocol Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol framework that will enable communication between all agents in the system using Google's official A2A SDK.
# Details:
Implement the A2A protocol using Google's official A2A SDK with the following components:

1. Integrate the A2A SDK components:
   - A2AFastAPIApplication for API endpoints
   - AgentCard for agent identity and metadata
   - AgentSkill for capability definitions
   - RequestHandler interface for processing requests
   - AgentExecutor interface for task execution

2. Implement capability discovery using AgentSkill:
   ```python
   # Using Google's A2A SDK AgentSkill type
   from a2a_sdk import AgentSkill
   
   # Example skill definition
   my_skill = AgentSkill(
       name="example_skill",
       description="Example skill description",
       input_schema={...},
       output_schema={...},
       version="1.0.0"
   )
   ```

3. Use the SDK's message format:
   ```python
   # Using Google's A2A SDK message types
   from a2a_sdk import A2ARequest, A2AResponse
   
   # The SDK handles message_id, correlation_id, and timestamps internally
   ```

4. Implement retry logic with the SDK's built-in mechanisms:
   ```python
   # The SDK provides retry functionality that we can configure
   from a2a_sdk.utils import configure_retries
   
   retry_config = configure_retries(max_retries=3, base_delay=1)
   ```

5. Use the SDK's authentication and authorization:
   - JWT-based authentication between agents
   - Role-based access control for capabilities

6. Leverage the SDK's built-in message versioning for backward compatibility

7. Utilize the SDK's logging and tracing:
   - Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Structured logging for all messages
   - Performance metrics collection

<info added on 2025-07-05T17:01:42.709Z>
Based on research findings, we'll implement a comprehensive authentication system for the A2A protocol:

1. Create AuthenticationCredentials model to support OAuth tokens and API keys, and SecurityLevel model to define agent access permissions.

2. Extend AgentCard schema to include security metadata fields for credential storage and security level declarations.

3. Develop HTTP authentication middleware that validates credentials from Authorization headers using Bearer token pattern.

4. Implement standard error handling for authentication (-32005) and authorization (-32006) failures using existing JSON-RPC error codes.

5. Update the base agent class with authentication methods for credential validation and security level enforcement.

6. Ensure all credential handling follows web security best practices, including secure storage, transmission, and validation processes.
